As a volunteer career guidance tutor at [Government Boys Higher Secondary School], I had the opportunity to mentor and support students in exploring their career options and higher education pathways. I conducted interactive sessions on various professions, entrance exams, scholarships, and vocational training opportunities, helping students make informed decisions about their futures. Through one-on-one counseling, I assisted them in identifying their strengths and aligning their aspirations with suitable career choices. Additionally, I organized workshops and invited professionals from different fields to provide real-world insights, inspiring students to pursue their goals with confidence. This experience not only enhanced my communication and mentoring skills but also allowed me to make a meaningful impact on the students' academic and professional journeys.
